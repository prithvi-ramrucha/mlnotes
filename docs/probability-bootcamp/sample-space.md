# 1. Sample Space

In probability theory, we consider **experiments** as abstraction for a thing that can happen: flipping a coin, rolling a dice, selecting a card from a deck of them, etc. The result, observation or measurement at 
the end of an experiment is called an **outcome**. We define a sample space $\Omega$ as the set of all possible outcomes that can result from an experiment. In other words, $\Omega$ contains all possiblities of an experiment that can occur.
